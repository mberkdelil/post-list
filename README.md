From the Visual Studio Code terminal, enter the folder where the project is located with the cd post-list-main command. Then download all the package files I use in the project with the npm install command. After the download is finished, start the project with the npm start command. After the project is opened, there are posts written on the left. When you click on it, the detail information of that mail will appear in the middle of the page. On the right side of the page is a list of people who have commented. There is an input field where you can search both the contact list and the post list. You can search dynamically.I am attaching a detailed video.
